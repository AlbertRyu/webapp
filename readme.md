I have been occupied fully, by my semester, it will be a miracle if this could be finised at all...

I want a more systematic way to learn web development, I researched a few major online commercial learning platform. None of them really catch me, either too expensive or bad content. I decided on [The Odin's Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard), which looks quite nice.
